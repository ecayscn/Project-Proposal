    "# STA130 Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this proposal, I outline three distinct analyses I plan to conduct using the Canadian Social Connection Survey (CSCS) data. Each analysis is designed to explore how social connections and community engagement relate to well-being, providing insights that could help raise awareness about the importance of social relationships for personal health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis 1: Social Interaction with Family and Self-Reported Well-Being\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "- **How does the frequency of social interactions with family relate to self-reported well-being?**\n",
    "- **Objective**: To explore if a higher frequency of family interactions is associated with higher levels of well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To determine if there is an association between family interaction frequency and self-reported well-being.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Correlation analysis will help assess if these two variables tend to move together, indicating a possible relationship.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - Both variables (interaction frequency and well-being) are continuous or can be treated as such.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data, handled appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To predict well-being based on family interaction frequency.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: This analysis will indicate how changes in interaction frequency might relate to changes in well-being.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - A linear relationship exists between interaction frequency and well-being.\n",
    "     - Variables are continuous or ordinal.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Group Comparisons (Two-Sample T-Test)**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To compare well-being between “high frequency” and “low frequency” interaction groups.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: This test will reveal if there is a significant difference in well-being between groups with different interaction frequencies.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - Well-being scores are normally distributed within each interaction group.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Visualization**\n",
    "   - **Suggested Visualizations**:\n",
    "     - **Histogram or Box Plot**: To display well-being scores across interaction frequency levels.\n",
    "     - **Scatter Plot**: To visually examine the relationship between interaction frequency and well-being.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Visualizations will provide preliminary insights into patterns or trends that support further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Higher family interaction frequency will correlate with higher well-being. This would highlight the importance of family connections in enhancing personal well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis 2: Community Engagement and Mental Health\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "- **Is there a correlation between community engagement (e.g., volunteering) and perceived mental health?**\n",
    "- **Objective**: To investigate if participating in community activities is associated with better mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To assess if a relationship exists between community engagement and mental health.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: This analysis helps to identify if changes in community engagement are associated with differences in mental health.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - Both variables are continuous or ordinal, or can be treated as such.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To predict mental health based on the level of community engagement.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: This approach helps determine if community engagement predicts mental health.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - Linear relationship exists between the variables.\n",
    "     - Both variables are continuous or ordinal.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Group Comparisons (Two-Sample T-Test)**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To compare mental health between engaged and non-engaged groups.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: A t-test will determine if there’s a statistically significant difference in mental health based on engagement.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - Mental health scores are normally distributed within each group.\n",
    "     - Groups are independent.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Visualization**\n",
    "   - **Suggested Visualizations**:\n",
    "     - **Stacked Bar Chart**: To show mental health levels across different engagement statuses.\n",
    "     - **Scatter Plot**: To visualize the relationship between engagement levels and mental health.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Visualizations can help identify potential trends and inform further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Individuals who are more engaged in their community will report better mental health, underscoring the mental health benefits of social involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis 3: Variation in Social Connection Across Age Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "- **Do levels of social connection vary significantly across different age groups?**\n",
    "- **Objective**: To explore if different age demographics have differing levels of social connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To determine if age is associated with social connection levels.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: This analysis can reveal if a general trend exists between age and social connection.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - Age and social connection can be treated as continuous variables or ordinal.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To predict social connection levels based on age.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Regression analysis will quantify how changes in age might relate to changes in social connection levels.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - Linear relationship between age and social connection.\n",
    "     - Variables are continuous or ordinal.\n",
    "     - Minimal missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Visualization**\n",
    "   - **Suggested Visualizations**:\n",
    "     - **Density Plot**: To show the distribution of social connection within each age group.\n",
    "     - **Line Chart**: To compare average social connection across age groups.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Visualization allows for a preliminary assessment of how social connection may vary with age.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Younger age groups will report higher social connection levels than older groups, potentially highlighting an age-related trend in social engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these analyses, I aim to understand how different aspects of social connection impact well-being, mental health, and engagement levels across age groups. These findings could offer valuable insights into public health strategies promoting social involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Group Team\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, I would like to work with Julia Chiriac."
